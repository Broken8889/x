# EaglercraftX 1.12 test server

Dead simple debug/testing server for Eaglercraft 1.12. Currently the client fails to connect, will fix that soon.

## How do I use this?
Basically, fork it, and run `java -jar bungee.jar` and `java -jar server.jar` in the corresponding folders, and it will run your very own Eaglercraft 1.12 server!

## How do I customize the server name?
Go into the `web/` folder and click on the [eaglercraft_opts.js](web/eaglercraft_opts.js) file. Everything from default language, to default servers (and names!), to website title and icon, to default server to join on page load; can all be customized in this file.

## How do I make custom textures?
With our new-and-improved **EagTek:tm:** 2.0 technology, you can now use vanilla 1.8 resource packs in your client. *(Alternatively, to change the default textures, and without using server resource packs (which also work :D), you can still customize the .epk file using my [web-based tool](https://ayunami2000.github.io/ayunWebEPK))*

## Where can I find plugins?
- [Spigot Plugins](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/categories/spigot.4/)
- [Bukkit Plugins](https://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins)
- [Cuberite Plugins](https://plugins.cuberite.org)

## Where is singleplayer?
Don't get your hopes up; it's probably not gonna happen.


## What if I don't want the client, and only the server?
Someone else will make that I'm sure. You can also go put it on the subreddit and if it gets enough upvotes I'll make an official one.
